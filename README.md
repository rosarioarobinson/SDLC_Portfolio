# Software Development Lifecycle Portfolio from CS 250 
The document included summarizes my interpretation and experiences during the course using the agile method and other Scrum practices. 

**How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?**
    
Interpreting user needs and implementing them into a program can consist of many different processes via developers and their perspective scrum team(s). For instance, scrum events and user stories help the most with understanding and interpreting user needs. User stories essentially are created to define what requirements are needed for developers. They are created not only for the scrum team to interpret but for the clients to understand what is being created by the developers. 
    
**How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?**
    
I hope to incorporate the agile process into my work, especially adapting to these methods while working with other companies. The agile method focuses mainly on smaller iterations over long periods. This approach while working with programs will help with my learning capabilities as well as being able to be more flexible with the programs themselves. 
    
**What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?**
    
In software development, being a good team member can come in many ways. Communication, I believe, is one of the most important aspects of being on a team, especially one that focuses on the agile method. Daily communications and updates via agile tools like JIRA (by Atlassian) create the environment for a good team to thrive and create the best products for their client(s).
